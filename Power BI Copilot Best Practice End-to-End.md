## 2. Data Preparation for Copilot

> **Importance of clean, well-modeled data - c**lean, well-modeled data is **crucial** for getting the most out of **Power BI Copilot**, which uses AI to help users explore data, generate DAX formulas, create visuals, and build reports using natural language. Here's why it matters

- **Metadata improves AI understanding -** Copilot uses metadata like table/column names and descriptions to understand context. Clear, descriptive names and annotations help Copilot generate more relevant and accurate outputs.

- **Relationships enable intelligent insights -** Defined relationships between tables allow Copilot to:

  *  Join data correctly

  *  Understand hierarchies and aggregations

  *  Avoid ambiguous or incorrect calculations

- **Data quality affects trust and usability -** Inconsistent, incomplete, or dirty data can lead to misleading insights, incorrect DAX suggestions or poor user experience

> **Schema design best practices**

 -   **Use a Star Schema -** Star schemas are easier for Copilot to interpret and generate correct aggregations and relationships.

 -   **Fact tables:** Contain measurable, quantitative data (e.g., sales, transactions).

 -   **Dimension tables:** Contain descriptive attributes (e.g., customer, product, date).

>   **Define Clear Relationships** - Copilot relies on relationships to understand how tables connect and to generate accurate joins and calculations

 -   Use single-directional relationships where possible.

 -   Avoid ambiguous or circular relationships.

 -   Ensure primary keys and foreign keys are properly defined.

>   **Use Meaningful Table and Column Names -** Copilot uses these names to interpret user intent and generate natural language responses

 -   Avoid cryptic or abbreviated names (e.g., tbl_cust â†’ Customers).

 -   Use CamelCase or PascalCase for readability.

>   **Add Descriptions to Tables and Fields -** Copilot uses metadata to understand context and improve the quality of its suggestions.

 -   Use the Model view in Power BI Desktop to add descriptions.

 -   Describe the purpose, units, and any business logic.

>    **Create and Document Measures -** Copilot can reuse and reference these measures when generating new insights.

 -   Use explicit measures instead of implicit ones.

 -   Name measures clearly (e.g., Total Sales, Average Order Value).

 -   Add descriptions to explain business logic.

>    **Avoid Overly Complex Models**

 -   Limit the number of tables and relationships to what's necessary.

 -   Use composite models or aggregated tables for performance.

>    **Enable Q&A and Copilot Features -** These settings directly impact how well Copilot can interpret natural language queries.

 -    Go to Model > Q&A setup and ensure:

 -    Synonyms are added for key terms.

 -    Unnecessary tables/columns are hidden from Q&A.

> **Naming conventions for tables and fields -** When using Power BI Copilot, adopting consistent and human-readable naming conventions is essential for improving the quality of AI-generated insights and ensuring a smooth user experience. Here are the key naming convention guidelines
 -    Use Human-Readable Names
 -    Avoid abbreviations or cryptic codes (e.g., use Customer Name instead of Cust_Nm)
 -    Use **Pascal Case** or **Title Case** for readability (e.g., SalesAmount, OrderDate)
 -    Be Descriptive and Specific
 -    Clearly distinguish similar fields across tables. For example:
      *  Customer Name in the Customer table
      *  Store Name in the Store table
      *  Avoid generic names like Name, Value, or Amount without context.
 -    **Avoid Duplicates Across Tables -** Ensure that field names are unique across the model to prevent confusion for Copilot and users.
 -    **Add Concise Descriptions -** Use the description property in Power BI Desktop to explain the purpose of each table, column, and measure. These descriptions help Copilot generate more accurate and context-aware responses
 -    **Consistency Across the Model -** Apply the same naming pattern across all tables and fields. For example, if you use TotalSales in one table, avoid using SalesTotal in another.

**Generate Synonyms with Copilot**

Using **synonyms in Power BI Copilot** offers several important benefits that significantly enhance the user experience and the effectiveness of natural language interactions. You can find the official Microsoft documentation on generating synonyms for Power BI Q&A and Copilot here:  [Enhance Q&A with Copilot for Power BI - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-copilot-enhancements)

> **Benefits of Using Synonyms in Power BI Copilot**

 -   **Improved Natural Language Understanding -** Users often use different terms than those defined in the data model. Synonyms help Copilot and Q&A interpret user queries more accurately, even if the exact field or table name isn't used, Example: If your model uses Customer ID, but users type "Client Number", synonyms bridge that gap.
 -   **Enhanced User Experience -** Users don't need to memorize technical or internal field names. They can ask questions in their own words, making the experience more intuitive and accessible-especially for non-technical users.
 -   **Support for Multilingual and Regional Variations -** Synonyms can include translations or regional terms (e.g., "Revenue" vs. "Turnover"). This is especially useful in global organizations with diverse user bases.
 -   **Better Copilot and Q&A Performance -** Synonyms increase the likelihood that Copilot will return relevant visuals or insights, reduce the number of failed or misunderstood queries.
 -   **Alignment with Business Terminology -** You can align technical field names with business-friendly terms. This ensures consistency between how data is modeled and how it's discussed across departments
